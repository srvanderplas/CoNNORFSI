Description: This package contains the code and paper describing CoNNOR, the
    Convolutional Neural Network for Outsole Recognition. This computer vision
    model can recognize geometric features in images of shoe outsoles, providing
    an automatic method for identifying tread characteristics for class 
    characteristic identification and matching.
